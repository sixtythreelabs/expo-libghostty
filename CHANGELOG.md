### 🛠 Breaking changes

### 🎉 New features

- Terminal effect events: `onBell` (BEL) and `onTitleChange` (OSC 0/2) on
  both platforms, plus `onDirectoryChange` (OSC 7/9/1337, value passed
  through as sent) on Android — the upstream iOS in-memory surface does not
  emit pwd actions yet. iOS routes the surface delegate; Android registers
  libghostty-vt effect callbacks and drains them after each write.
- Baseline screen-reader support. Android: the terminal announces as
  "Terminal" (overridable via `accessibilityLabel`), accessory keys expose
  names ("Escape", "Control", …) with a button role, sticky modifiers report
  their armed/locked state (API 30+), and decorative dividers are skipped.
  iOS: the terminal surface is a VoiceOver element with direct interaction,
  matching the upstream accessory bar's existing labels.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

### 💡 Others

- Dependency bump: libghostty-spm 1.3.1 → 1.5.1 (XCFramework
  `upstream.1.3.1-2`, Ghostty v1.3.1), MSDisplayLink 2.1.0 → 2.2.0,
  libghostty-vt to ghostty `3c1ef5b` (Zig 0.16.0, Nerd Fonts v3.5.1).
  Android JNI follows the new vt C API (`ghostty_terminal_new` cols/rows,
  mode query via `GHOSTTY_TERMINAL_DATA_MODE`, colors via
  `GHOSTTY_RENDER_STATE_DATA_COLORS`). Expo SDK 57.0.19 / React Native
  0.86.3, ESLint 10.9.1 and typescript-eslint 8.69.0. `tsc` is TypeScript
  7.0.2 (`@typescript/native`); the `typescript` package is
  `@typescript/typescript6` so ESLint still has a compiler API (TypeScript
  7 has none until 7.1).
- iOS: `clipboard-write = ask` so OSC 52 cannot silently replace the
  system pasteboard. User paste still proceeds; program clipboard
  read/write is denied until a host supplies confirmation UI.
- First automated test suites: vitest covers the TerminalView imperative
  queue (the 0.8.1 mount-race contract), and JUnit covers the Android
  snapshot wire format, cell color resolution, and the sticky-modifier state
  machine (extracted into `SnapshotFormat.kt` / `StickyModifier.kt`). Both
  run in CI.
- iOS vendor bump: libghostty-spm 1.2.11 → 1.3.1 (GhosttyKit rebuilt from a
  newer ghostty, scroll-remainder fix; `TerminalSurfaceOptions` gains an
  additive `envVars` option for exec backends — unused by this module's
  in-memory backend).

## 0.8.1 — 2026-07-17

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Imperative calls (`write`, `writeText`, `finish`) issued before the native
  view finished registering — e.g. `write()` in a mount effect — were
  rejected with "unable to find view" and silently dropped in release builds,
  where JS starts faster than the UI thread commits. `TerminalView` now
  queues such calls and flushes them, in order, once the view reports its
  first grid size.

### 💡 Others

- Every pod now ships a `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` privacy manifest:
  GhosttyTerminal declares system-boot-time access (`ProcessInfo.systemUptime`
  for elapsed-time measurement, reason 35F9.1) and GhosttyKit declares
  file-timestamp access (`fstat`/`fstatat` referenced by the prebuilt
  libghostty binary, reason C617.1); ExpoLibghostty and MSDisplayLink declare
  no accessed APIs. Fixes App Store ITMS-91053 warnings for consumers.
- CI now builds the Android example as a minified release (exercising R8
  over the module) and builds the example for the iOS simulator on macOS.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-07-17

### 🎉 New features

- `theme` prop on both platforms: `background`, `foreground`, `cursorColor`,
  `selectionBackground`, `selectionForeground`, and `palette` overrides by
  index (0–255). Values use ghostty config syntax (hex or X11 names).
  Android sets the terminal's default colors through libghostty-vt (so OSC
  4/10/11/12 queries and resets stay truthful) per view; iOS applies the
  theme app-wide through the shared controller's config.
- Android: the keyboard accessory bar now mirrors the iOS input accessory
  bar — same default key set (esc/tab/ctrl/alt, arrows, shell symbols,
  paste) as circular buttons, and the same sticky-modifier cycle: tap arms
  Ctrl/Alt for the next key, a quick double tap locks them (with the bottom
  indicator) until tapped again.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-17

### 🎉 New features

- Android: pinch-to-zoom font size, mirroring iOS (every 0.1 of pinch scale
  steps ±1 dp, clamped to 4–64). The grid reflows in place — no output is
  lost — and the host sees a normal `onResize`.
- `fontSize` prop on both platforms: base font size in density-independent
  units (default 14). Android applies changes live; on iOS a change after
  mount rebuilds the terminal surface (grid resets), so set it before
  mounting.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-17

### 🎉 New features

- Android: keyboard accessory bar (Esc / Ctrl / Alt / Tab / arrows / nav)
  above the soft keyboard. Ctrl and Alt are sticky and compose the next key
  — from the bar, the IME, or a hardware keyboard — through ghostty's
  encoder. The view now pads itself above the IME in edge-to-edge windows,
  so the covered grid rows come back too.
- Android: inertial scrollback (fling), a fading scroll-position indicator,
  and a jump-to-bottom chip; typed input snaps back to the live view.
- Android: selection polish — long-press keeps extending the selection
  without lifting, drags show the system magnifier (API 28+), and the end
  handle accounts for wide (CJK) final cells.

### 💡 Others

- CI now compiles the Android module (and lints/builds the JS) on every
  push and pull request.
- Cleaned up `create-expo-module` scaffold leftovers: LICENSE attribution is
  now ArcBox, Inc., the podspec version is read from `package.json`, the
  unused jest and webpack scaffolding is gone, and the example app has
  terminal-themed icons instead of the Expo defaults.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-17

### 🎉 New features

- Android: touch selection and clipboard. Long-press selects the word under
  the finger (ghostty word-boundary semantics); draggable handles adjust the
  range; the floating action-mode toolbar offers Copy / Paste / Select all.
  Copy extracts text with ghostty's copy semantics (unwrap + trim); paste is
  encoded through ghostty (control-byte strip, bracketed paste when mode 2004
  is set) with a confirmation dialog for multi-line clipboard content.
  Selection follows scrollback via terminal-tracked references and clears on
  any typed input.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-17

### 🎉 New features

- Android: Nerd Font private-use glyphs (powerline, devicons, material, …)
  now render via a bundled Symbols Nerd Font Mono instead of tofu. The font
  ships in the vendor tarball and is exposed as an AAR asset; cells whose
  first codepoint is in U+E000–F8FF or U+F0000+ draw with it.
- Android: cursor blink. Follows the terminal's DECSCUSR-driven blink state
  (blinking by default), holds solid on input/output, pauses when the window
  is unfocused, and respects the system animations-off setting.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-16

### 🎉 New features

- Android support: libghostty-vt (ghostty's VT state machine) driven through a
  JNI shim with a Kotlin Canvas renderer — same JS contract as iOS
  (`onInput`/`onResize` events; `write`/`writeText`/`finish` methods). Covers
  colors, wide CJK cells, color emoji, bold/italic/underline/strikethrough,
  IME text input, hardware keys via ghostty's key encoder, and scrollback
  gestures. arm64-v8a + x86_64; prebuilt static libs are fetched
  checksum-pinned at install time (`scripts/download-android-libs.mjs`,
  built by CI from a pinned ghostty commit).
